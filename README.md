### About Verifee
I created this project after struggling to understand a lot of terms used in Regular Expressions which really halted my ability to
progress with more advanced verification for common attributes used in user accounts like; Usernames, Passwords, Emails, Date of
Births and eventually a lot more. Verifee includes a lot of different techniques to validate specific attributes, giving them 
their own unique security and ensuring that Enterprise (Hopefully:smile:) applications are reliable.

### How to use Verifee
Adding Verifee to your product is extremely simple
#### 1. Adding to your project using NuGet Package Manager

![NuGet Package Manager](/images/screenshot1.png)
Click 'update' if you already have it or 'install' if you are downloading for the first time.<br>
#### 2. Verifying an attribute

![Verifying an email example](/images/screenshot2.png)
Initalise the object of whatever attribute you wish to verify, using the value as a parameter in the constructor, then call the
respective method for the attribute you wish to specify :smile:
<br>The screenshot above shows the verification of an email, firstly the email provider is confirmed and then finally, a confirmation code is sent to the users email to verify the account. (Confirmation is currently still in the process of being created!)
