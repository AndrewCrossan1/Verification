### About Verifee
I created this project after struggling to understand a lot of terms used in Regular Expressions which really halted my ability to
progress with more advanced verification for common attributes used in user accounts like; Usernames, Passwords, Emails, Date of
Births and eventually a lot more. Verifee includes a lot of different techniques to validate specific attributes, giving them 
their own unique security and ensuring that Enterprise (Hopefully:smile:) applications are reliable.

Click 'update' if you already have it or 'install' if you are downloading for the first time.
2. Verifying an attribute

Initalise the object of whatever attribute you wish to verify, using the value as a parameter in the constructor, then call the
respective method for the attribute you wish to specify :smile:
